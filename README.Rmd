The `joineR` package implements methods for analyzing data from
longitudinal studies in which the response from each subject consists of
a time-sequence of repeated measurements and a possibly censored
time-to-event outcome. The modelling framework for the repeated
measurements is the linear model with random effects and/or correlated
error structure (Laird and Ware, 1982). The model for the time-to-event
outcome is a Cox proportional hazards model with log-Gaussian frailty
(Cox, 1972). Stochastic dependence is captured by allowing the Gaussian
random effects of the linear model to be correlated with the frailty
term of the Cox proportional hazards model. The methodology used to fit
the model is described in Henderson et al. (2002) and Wulfsohn and
Tsiatis (1997).

The `joineR` package also allows competing risks data to be jointly
modelled through a cause-specific hazards model. The importance of
accounting for competing risks is detailed in Williamson et al.
(2007a,b). The methodology used to fit this model is described in
Williamson et al. (2008).

# Example

The `joineR` package comes with several data sets including one the
describes the survival of patients who underwent aortic valve
replacement surgery. The patients were routinely followed up in clinic,
where the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated. To fit a
joint model, we must first create a `jointdata` object, which holds the
survival, longitudinal, and baseline covariate data, along with the
names of the columns that identify the patient identifiers and repeated
time outcomes.

```{r joint_data}
library(joineR)
data(heart.valve)
heart.surv <- UniqueVariables(heart.valve, 
                              var.col = c("fuyrs", "status"),
                              id.col = "num")
heart.long <- heart.valve[, c("num", "time", "log.lvmi")]
heart.cov <- UniqueVariables(heart.valve, 
                             c("age", "hs", "sex"), 
                             id.col = "num")
heart.valve.jd <- jointdata(longitudinal = heart.long, 
                            baseline = heart.cov, 
                            survival = heart.surv, 
                            id.col = "num", 
                            time.col = "time")
```

With the creation of the `heart.valve.jd` object, we can fit a joint
model using the `joint` function. For this, we need 4 arguments:

-   `jointdata`: the data object we created above
-   `long.formula`: the linear mixed effects model formula for the
    longitudinal sub-model
-   `surv.formula`: the survival formula the survival sub-model
-   `model`: the latent association structure.

```{r joint_model}
fit <- joint(data = heart.valve.jd, 
             long.formula = log.lvmi ~ 1 + time + hs, 
             surv.formula = Surv(fuyrs, status) ~ hs, 
             model = "intslope")

summary(fit)
```

Full details on the data and the functions are provided in the help
documentation and package vignette. The purpose of this code is to
simply illustrate the ease and speed in fitting the models.

# Multivariate data

`joineR` only models a single repeated measurement and a single event
time. If multiple longitudinal outcomes are available (see Hickey et
al., 2016), a separate package is available:
[`joineRML`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=joineRML).
